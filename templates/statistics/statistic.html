        </p>
        <p class="bodytext" style="background-color: azure;">
            Close to 50 percent of Bangladesh's population is primarily employed in agriculture, with more than 70
            percent of its land dedicated to growing crops. Major crops cultivated include rice, jute, wheat, tea,
            pulses, oil-seeds, vegetables and fruits.
            Yet despite agriculture contributing to such a large percentage of Bangladesh's overall economy, it has
            remained largely subsistence based, with uncertain crop yields and inefficient infrastructure limiting
            the ability of farmers to fully commercialize
            their production. Recognizing this environment, an In-depth Country Assessment, conducted as part of the
            Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics, concluded that the Bangladesh Bureau of
            Statistics needs to improve internal
            and external coordination with statistics producers and users. A plan focused specifically on
            agriculture is needed to complement and supplement national strategies for the development of
            statistics. Data gaps in several core areas already being
            studied such as food balance sheets, livestock and agri-environmental indicators need to be filled to
            produce more effective statistics and enable more informed responses to these issues. Amongst those
            tasked with using and analyzing statistics,
            knowledge and skills need to be further developed.

        <p class="bodytext">The Global Strategy in Asia Pacific has proposed meeting agricultural and rural statistics
            needs in Bangladesh through the following actions.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">· Develop a Strategic Plan for Agricultural and Rural Statistics (SPARS)
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">· Strengthen the agricultural crop estimation system

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext" style="background-color:azure;">Strengthened coordination mechanisms and institutional relationships have resulted in the
            Bangladesh government preparing and adopting a strategy paper to improve agriculture and rural statistics. A
            survey calendar and integrated plan for surveys
            has also been established. A roadmap for a SPARS has also been completed and endorsed by the government. The
            roadmap has been integrated into Bangladesh's agricultural sector development plan. The Global Strategy in
            Asia Pacific is currently collaborating
            with the government to develop a working SPARS.
